My solutions to HackerRank's "30 Days of Code" tutorials.

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)'s ["30 Days of Code"](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) tutorial series seemed too simple for me.  I have many years of experience as a professional software developer in multiple languages and HR's series began with a challenge named "Day 0: Hello, World."  However, I saw that some challenges of the later days would be a little more worthy of my skills, so I decided to give it a try.  My reasoning was:

* Some of the challenges would be quite different than the ones I see at work.
* I could make the challenges a little more difficult for myself by treating them as "[code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)":  Try to solve the challenge with the least amount of code or the most efficient code possible.
* I have a lot of experience with Python 2 and a few years with Python 3, so this would be a low-risk way for me to improve my skills with the newer version.
* I could revisit this challenge later, using a programming language that's totally new to me.

I've completed the 30 days using Python 3, so I'm making this repo to archive my code.  When it's convenient, I'll start the challenge again with another language, like Go or some other.
